Product Monitor
===============

A HTML/JavaScript template for monitoring a product by encouraging product developers to gather all the information about the status of a product. The idea is to provide components to bring live monitoring, statistics, endpoints, and test results all into one place.

Uses a pattern of HTML/JavaScript components which can be created and customised in order to use your own declarative XML tags to create a monitor customised to your project's needs.
